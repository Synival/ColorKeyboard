# Color Keyboard Applet

*Contains sample MIDI "Fugue No. 15 from 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op 87 by Dmitri Shostakovich".  Sequenced by Jos√© Oscar de Almeida Marques.  Website: [Dmitri Shostakvoich MIDI](http://www.kunstderfuge.com/shostakovitch.htm)*

This project was originally finished in April, 2003 as part of a Java class at Western Oregon University.  Although applets are largely depcrecated, this program is still quite fun to play around with.
